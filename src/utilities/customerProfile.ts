/**
 * The rules for the delivery details a customer saves on their profile
 * (design.md §6.13).
 *
 * Client-safe like the auth schemas, and for the same reason: the account form
 * checks the same rules in the browser before it submits, and the server action
 * runs them again as the real gate. One source of truth, so a client rule that is
 * looser than the server rule can never show a green tick on a form about to fail.
 *
 * The profile as a whole is optional — an account can exist with no address on it —
 * but a customer who saves it gives us the whole delivery set. The form requires
 * the delivery fields rather than storing half an address.

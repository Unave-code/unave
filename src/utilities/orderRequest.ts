 * What a customer can ask the kitchen to do with a paid order (design.md §6.15).
 *
 * A paid order is never edited again — its amounts and its product snapshot are the
 * receipt — so stopping or skipping one is a request rather than a change. Each
 * request is its own row for the kitchen to answer, and this schema is the rule
 * both sides of the network share: the dialog checks it in the browser, the
 * server action runs it again as the real gate.
 *
 * A cancellation needs nothing but the press; a pause needs the two days it
 * covers, because "pause" without dates cannot be acted on.

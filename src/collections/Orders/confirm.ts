/**
 * Writing the paid order, which happens exactly once (spec 0007).
 *
 * A row is born here and nowhere else. The two payment signals — the browser's
 * verified return and the signed webhook — can arrive, and they can arrive
 * together, so this is the single place either one lands. The gateway order id
 * is unique in the collection, which is the whole guard: two racers both try to
 * insert, one wins, and the loser reads the winner's row and sends no mail.
 *
 * An order row therefore means one completed payment. There is no pending state
 * to upkeep and abandoned checkouts leave nothing behind.

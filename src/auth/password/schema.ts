 *
 * - the browser, where the form checks the same rules before it posts;
 * - the Payload endpoints, which are the real gate;
 * - `password.ts`, which only needs the two length bounds.
 *
 * Keeping one source of truth matters more here than anywhere else in the app: a
 * client rule that is looser than the server rule shows a green tick on a form that
 * is about to fail, and a client rule that is tighter blocks a valid password.

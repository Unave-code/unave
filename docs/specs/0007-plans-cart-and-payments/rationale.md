# 0007 rationale: plans and payments

## Context

> ⚠️ Premise note: requiring sign in to buy trades conversion for accountability. The design contract until today promised that an account only saves details, and guest checkout would have honored it. The engineer chose sign in required knowingly, so the kitchen always knows who ordered and can reach them; the cost is that a ready to buy visitor without an account must stop and create one first, and some of them will not. The contract change is recorded in the spec and `design.md` must be amended, not quietly ignored.

The kitchen previously sold plans through the site: that build (plans, subscriptions, payments, cart, checkout) was removed on 2026-10-31 after being completed, its tables dropped and its specs deleted, because the kitchen went back to taking orders by message. The same day the decision reversed again: the kitchen wants to sell through the site. The old code exists in git history but the site has moved on since it was written (customer accounts rebuilt under spec 0005, the mail system reworked under spec 0002), so this design starts fresh and borrows patterns, not code.

Forces at play:

- Real money changes hands, so every amount, every state change and every identity claim must be verifiable on the server, and the paid signal must survive the customer closing the browser.
- The team is small and the site is one Next.js and Payload codebase with Postgres; an operations light design (no queues, no new services, no new dependencies) is worth more than an extensible one.
- The design contract (`docs/design/design.md`) governs every surface, and until today promised accounts never gate anything; this feature changes that one promise deliberately.
- India is the market: Razorpay is the named gateway, INR the currency, paise the unit.

Not deciding means the site keeps promising orders by message while the kitchen wants online sales, and every order stays manual.

## Options considered

These options were weighed on 2026-10-31, when a cart still held several plans. The revision at the end of this file records why the cart was later removed.

### Option 1: Keep taking orders by message

No build. The site keeps its current promise and the kitchen keeps doing manual order taking over WhatsApp, phone and email.

**Pros**:

- Zero cost, zero risk, and the staff already run the kitchen this way.

**Cons**:

- The kitchen asked to sell online; declining the feature is not a design.

### Option 2: Payload collections plus Razorpay Standard Checkout, direct REST (recommended)

A `plans` catalogue and an `orders` collection in Payload, a browser cookie cart, a checkout endpoint that recomputes prices and calls `POST /v1/orders` over REST, the Standard Checkout popup in the browser, a verified return plus a signed idempotent webhook, and both emails through the existing transport.

**Pros**:

- The standard integration for a custom site: the buying experience stays inside the brand, and the server stays the only authority on money.
- No new dependency (two REST calls and two HMAC checks with Node's crypto), matching how the mail module talks to ZeptoMail.
- Reuses the session model (spec 0005), the mail transport and settings (spec 0002), the endpoint and rate limit pattern (spec 0006), and the guarded migration habit.

**Cons**:

- Hand written gateway plumbing must itself be correct: raw body HMAC for the webhook, idempotency, and the popup lifecycle are the builder's job, not a library's.

### Option 3: Hosted Razorpay Payment Pages

Razorpay hosts the whole buying page; the site links out to it per plan.

**Pros**:

- The least code that can take money; no checkout page, no cart, no popup integration to build.

**Cons**:

- The buying experience leaves the site and the design contract does not travel; the cart (a core ask) cannot exist; linking out per duration fights the catalogue.

### Option 4: Restore the removed build from git history

Pull the deleted plans, cart, checkout and Razorpay code back and adapt it.

**Pros**:

- The fastest path to working code, and it once passed through this same pipeline.

**Cons**:

- It was written against a site that no longer exists: an older account model, an older mail system, and a plans model (with subscriptions) the kitchen no longer sells. Adapting it means reviewing every line against today's contracts anyway, and the engineer explicitly chose to build fresh.

## Rationale

Option 2 wins on the forces that matter here. Money correctness comes from the server being the only authority on amounts and the webhook plus return check covering the closed browser case; both live naturally in this design. Operational weight stays near zero: no new dependency, no new service, one migration, and admin surfaces that arrive free with Payload. The alternatives fail on the stated requirements rather than on taste: Option 1 declines the ask, Option 3 cannot host a cart inside the brand, and Option 4 drags a superseded architecture back onto a changed site.

The engineer's choices that shaped this: a plan is one catalogue entry with duration options priced in paise; the first build held several plans in a cart, and a 2026-11-01 revision removed it in favour of one plan per order; deliveries start when the kitchen decides, so the order carries no customer promised date, only an optional staff filled `startsOn`; cancellations and refunds stay manual (fulfilment states are deferred in scope); the confirmation email doubles as the receipt, so no invoice machinery exists; and the gateway is Razorpay by name, kept out of the scope row but confirmed here.

The runner up is Option 4, and it is a real runner up: if this build stalls, reviving the old code remains cheaper than this spec. What tips the balance today is that the old build's centre of gravity (subscriptions, guest links) was exactly what got removed, while the parts of today's site it would collide with (the rebuilt `customers` collection, the reworked mail keys, the amended design contract) are the parts that changed most.

The cross check pass hardened the mechanics the first draft left to the builder, and the spec now owns them: the webhook is a plain route handler because the signature needs the raw request bytes; the paid order is written once, guarded by the unique gateway order id, so the return path and the webhook cannot both write it or both send the mails; every gateway signal must match the intent on the gateway order's amount, currency and order id before it counts; and the checkout link carries only a plan slug and duration label, so every amount is read from the record.

## Revision, 2026-11-01: the cart was removed

The engineer decided the shelf should sell one plan at a time: a customer presses Buy now on a card and lands on checkout with that plan and duration. The cart, its cookie, the 20 line cap, the duplicate rule and the `/cart` page all go.

Why:

- The cart existed to let one payment cover several plans. In practice a plan is bought on its own, and the cart bought real complexity for no revenue: a cookie format, duplicate refusals, a cart page with empty and unknown line states, merge rules, and a second place where totals were computed.
- A checkout link carries identifiers only, so the server reads the live price at checkout. The cart's label, days and price matching rule existed only because the cookie carried a price. That whole class of tampering disappears.
- One plan per order makes the order, its two emails and the admin view simpler to read. A customer who wants two plans buys twice.

The cost: no mixed basket, two payments where one used to do, and the loss of the cart's keep browsing convenience. The `orders.items` array stays, holding exactly one item, so a basket can return later without a schema change. This is recorded as a spec decision, not treated as an implementation detail.

## Revision, 2026-11-01 (later): only completed payments are recorded

The engineer's rule: an unpaid checkout must never leave a row behind. Many people reach checkout and leave without paying, and a table of pending rows is upkeep with no revenue.

What changed:

- `orders.status` and the pending and confirming states are gone. A row is written only when a captured payment is confirmed, so a row always means one completed payment.
- The create endpoint writes no row. The plan, its duration, its price and the delivery details ride on the Razorpay order's own notes, so the intent survives a closed browser without a local table to prune.
- The verify return and the signed webhook both write the one paid row, guarded by the unique `gatewayOrderId`: two signals race, one insert wins, one set of mails.
- A migration deletes rows that were never paid and drops the status column.

Why: the pending row existed only to be flipped later, and it carried the cost of abandoned checkouts. Putting the intent on the gateway order removes the local state entirely while still letting the webhook record a payment whose browser never came back. The tradeoff is that a long kitchen note is capped on the gateway order, and an abandoned checkout leaves no local trace, which is the point.

## Revision, 2026-11-06: the cart returns

> ⚠️ Premise note: this revision deliberately reverses the removal below, made the day before. The removal's reasons were real and stay true: a cart buys complexity for a one product shop. What changed is the premise it rested on: the kitchen has concrete products coming (combos, add ons) that make sense together in one basket, so the cost is now paid for a known need, not avoided for a hypothetical one. The revision restores the cart with the removal's own lessons built in, rather than pretending the removal never happened.

The trigger is upcoming products, and the engineer chose the shape in four answers:

- **Restore the old shape**: any open plan, one line per plan and duration, the same plan and duration twice refused, a line cap. The cap drops from the old 20 to 10 because the checkout intent rides on the gateway order's notes and ten lines fit comfortably where twenty may not.
- **A cart page and a header count**: `/cart` for review and removal, and a live count in the header so the basket is visible from anywhere.
- **Add to cart only**: every open plan card carries a duration choice and one Add to cart control; the direct Buy now checkout link is retired, so every purchase flows through the basket. This also simplifies the cards (one primary action each, per the design contract).
- **Sign in at checkout stays** (the contract amendment from this spec stands, unamended).

What the revision keeps from the removal's lessons, so the old pain points do not come back with the cart:

- The cookie carries identifiers only (plan slug, duration label). The old price matching rule existed because the cookie carried prices; that class of tampering stays dead, and totals are computed from the database at every render and at order creation.
- The cart never lives on the server, so the old merge rules have nothing to merge: the cookie survives sign in untouched.
- Only completed payments are recorded, unchanged: the multi line intent rides on the gateway order's notes (lines as indexed note keys, each value short), and one paid row holds up to ten immutable line snapshots.

The AC renumbering, since the old set was written for one plan per order: old AC-2 (direct link) splits into the new AC-2 (cart add rules) and AC-3 (cart page); old AC-3 becomes AC-4; old AC-4 becomes AC-5; old AC-5 becomes AC-6; old AC-6 becomes AC-7; old AC-7 becomes AC-8; old AC-8 becomes AC-9; old AC-9 becomes AC-10; old AC-10 becomes AC-11; old AC-11 becomes AC-12; old AC-12 becomes AC-13. AC-1 keeps its number and loses the buy wording.

The tradeoff accepted: the cart's complexity is back, bounded by the cap, the identifier only cookie and the no server cart rule. The engineer chose this knowingly for a concrete pipeline of products, and the build plan tasks 14 to 19 carry it.

## Revision, 2026-11-12: Best sellers product card data

The homepage already selects available featured products from the Products collection, but its card has no source for an old price or pack size. One time products have a single price, while meal plans have separate prices for each duration. The card therefore needs optional data that fits the existing product types without changing the cart or order model.

### Options considered

#### Option 1: Keep the current card

Continue showing the current price only.

**Pros**:

- No schema change or extra admin work.

**Cons**:

- The card cannot show the comparison price and pack size from the supplied image.

#### Option 2: Add optional fields to one time products (chosen)

Add a paise based old price and plain text pack size to the existing Products collection. Derive the discount from the two prices.

**Pros**:

- The card reads product details from the same record staff already maintain.
- Missing values remain valid, and existing product rows need no backfill.
- One time products have one current price, so the comparison is unambiguous.

**Cons**:

- Staff must keep the reference price and pack size accurate.
- A comparison price on a plan would be ambiguous because each duration has a different price.

#### Option 3: Add comparison prices to every plan duration and structured pack units

Store an old price alongside each plan duration, and split pack size into an amount and unit.

**Pros**:

- Discounts could be shown for plans and size values could be normalized.

**Cons**:

- Neither is needed for the requested card. This adds fields and admin choices to products that do not use them.
- A plan's discount would appear beside a per day lead price while its actual selected totals vary by duration.

## Rationale

The existing Product model already distinguishes a one time price from a meal plan's duration prices. Optional fields on one time products are the smallest change that gives the card a reliable source and leaves plans accurate. The discount percentage is derived from the current and old prices, so the admin cannot save a percentage that contradicts them. The text pack size is enough for display and does not introduce unit conversion rules. The engineer chose this data shape. The system can check that an old price exceeds the current price, but staff remain responsible for keeping the reference price truthful.

# 0008. Plan category pages

**Date**: 2026-11-05
**Revised**: 2026-11-06, a subcategory layer is added: an admin managed option list per category, required on every plan, filtered on the category pages beside the audience. New criteria AC-8 to AC-10; the earlier criteria keep their numbers and their meaning.
**Revised**: 2026-11-06, the filter controls gain art: each audience pill carries an icon beside its label, and the subcategory controls become round image tiles, each fed by an optional image on the option. New criterion AC-11; AC-2, AC-8 and AC-10 keep their numbers and their meaning.
**Revised**: 2026-11-06, the subcategory filter row is withdrawn from the category pages, so the audience pills are each page's only filter; the subcategory data layer stays. AC-10 is withdrawn and AC-11 is narrowed to the audience pills.
**Status**: In Progress

## Summary

Each plan category gets its own page: ready to cook, ready to eat, and fresh from produce, at web addresses like `/plans/ready-to-cook`. The words on the page (headlines, intros) live in code, while the plan cards on it come from the Plans collection in the admin, the same split every existing page uses. Each page carries pills that filter the plans by audience (All, Kids, Adults, Special), and the category labels on plan cards become links to these pages. The 2026-11-06 revision adds a subcategory layer: the kitchen manages a list of finer labels per category in the admin and every plan carries one. A second filter row for those labels was tried on the category pages and then withdrawn, so the audience pills carry the page's only filter. The same revision gives those pills art: each carries an icon beside its label.

## Context

Plans now carry two labels, a category (how the meal reaches the customer) and an audience (who it is for), but the site shows every plan in one flat shelf on `/plans`. A visitor who only wants ready to cook meals, or who is ordering for children, has to scan the whole shelf and mentally filter. Category pages give each group a focused shelf and a shareable web address.

Forces at play:

- The repo already splits content the same way everywhere: structured data lives in Payload collections the kitchen edits (Plans, Header, Footer), while page copy lives in code files (`homeCopy.ts`, `plansCopy.ts`, `aboutCopy.ts`). No existing page keeps its copy in the admin.
- There is no designer and no design tool connected; `docs/design/design.md` plus the built plans page already define every visual piece these pages need.
- Browsing stays open to everybody, no account and no hint of one (a hard rule in `AGENTS.md`).
- The kitchen is small; every admin surface added is surface somebody must maintain.

Not deciding means the labels stay inert text, the only browsing aid stays the one flat shelf, and sharing a link that shows only kid friendly ready to eat plans stays impossible.

## Requirements

**User stories**:

- As a visitor, I want a page that shows only one category of plans, so that I compare like with like.
- As a visitor, I want to narrow a category page to an audience (kids, adults, special), so that I find meals for my household.
- As the kitchen, I want the category labels on plan cards to lead to these pages, so that browsing by category needs no extra menu work from me.
- As the kitchen, I want to define and edit the subcategory list for each category in the admin, so that finer grouping never needs a developer.

**Acceptance criteria** (the contract, each criterion is IDed and independently checkable):

- **AC-1**: `/plans/ready-to-cook`, `/plans/ready-to-eat` and `/plans/fresh-from-produce` each render with a green opening band (the category name and a one line intro) and a grid of that category's plans. Open plans are buyable; paused plans render with the paused label and no buy action, and the paused plans notice renders whenever the category has paused plans, exactly as on `/plans`.
- **AC-2**: Each category page has an audience filter with the choices All, Kids, Adults and Special. All is the default. Each choice is a pill carrying its own icon beside its label. Choosing a pill filters the visible cards in the browser with no page reload and no change to the web address. The pills meet the design system's accessibility rules: a labelled group of buttons with pressed state, 44px targets, a polite live region that announces how many plans match, and no motion.
- **AC-3**: When a category has no plans at all, the page shows the same empty state card the plans page uses: a heading, a line of copy, and the WhatsApp button when the footer carries a number. When a filter choice matches no card (but the category has plans), the same card component shows with a filter specific line, so the copy never claims the shelf is empty when it is only filtered.
- **AC-4**: A category web address that is not one of the three category values renders the site group's not found page.
- **AC-5**: On `/plans` and on the home page, each plan card's category pill is a link to that category's page, with a distinct accessible name (for example "Browse ready to cook plans") and AA contrast in its green treatment. Each category page links to the other two category pages as a plain text link row under the grid.
- **AC-6**: Each category page carries its own title, description and canonical URL, and appears in the sitemap generated by the pages sitemap route.
- **AC-7**: A plan's slug can never equal one of the three category route slugs, so the address space under `/plans` never carries two meanings. The three category slugs are reserved; audience values take no route space and are not reserved.
- **AC-8**: A Subcategories collection grouped with the store content holds the option list: a title (the filter label) and exactly one category each (the same three values the Plans category select uses), identified by the document id (no slug field: nothing public reads one, and two categories may each carry a same named option). Staff manage the list entirely in the admin, and a plan's subcategory picker offers only the subcategories of the plan's own category.
- **AC-9**: Every plan carries exactly one subcategory from its own category, required with no default: creating or editing a plan without one is refused, and a plan whose subcategory belongs to a different category is refused on save. A subcategory that plans still use cannot be deleted; staff reassign those plans first. The three plans that existed before this revision stay unassigned until staff assign them in the admin, and the migration that adds the field touches no existing row.
- **AC-10 (withdrawn 2026-11-06)**: A second filter row for subcategories briefly followed AC-11 on the category pages. It is withdrawn: the pages carry the audience filter only, and the subcategory layer stays in the admin and on the plans, read by no page filter.
- **AC-11**: Each audience pill carries art: an icon drawn from code shipped with the site (one per audience, plus All), shown beside its label. The icon is decorative to assistive technology, the label stays the pill's accessible name, the pill keeps a 44px target and a pressed state, and there is no motion beyond a colour change.

## Options considered

### Option 1: Code copy with one dynamic route (chosen)

One Next.js route (`/plans/[category]`) reads the category from the web address, pulls that category's plans from the Plans collection through Payload's local API, and takes its words from a new code file next to `plansCopy.ts`. The three categories are fixed values of the select field, so the route accepts exactly three slugs.

**Pros**:
- Matches the established split in the repo: copy in code, data in the admin
- One file to build and style, three pages for free; no new admin surface
- Copy changes go through git, so they are reviewed and versioned like the rest of the site

**Cons**:
- The kitchen cannot reword a category page without a developer and a deploy

### Option 2: Fully CMS managed category pages

A new Payload collection (or global per category) holds each category page's headline, intro and photo; staff edit them in the admin.

**Pros**:
- Copy changes need no deploy and no developer

**Cons**:
- A whole new admin surface to build, style, and keep on brand (the admin is a branded surface by rule, so every field carries styling weight)
- Two homes for one story: the category value lives on the plan, the category page copy lives elsewhere, and they can drift
- The kitchen's real editing need, prices and availability, is already covered by Plans

### Option 3: Static pages, one per category

Three hand written page files, each with its own copy and its own grid query.

**Pros**:
- Zero indirection; each page is plain to read

**Cons**:
- Three copies of the same layout and query logic to keep in step
- Adding a fourth category means a fourth page; the select field already makes that a data change, so code would lag behind data

## Decision

**Chosen option**: Option 1: Code copy with one dynamic route

One dynamic route serves all three category pages, with copy from a shared code module and plan data from the CMS. The pages render force-dynamic like `/plans`, so live prices and paused states are always current. The `/plans` page itself stays unchanged except that badges become links. The 2026-11-06 revision extends this same option with a subcategory layer: a new admin managed collection and a second client side filter row; the single dynamic route, the code copy and the reserved slugs are unchanged.

**Implementation skills**: none used for this design (the project's own `design.md` and existing page patterns were the authority)

## Rationale

The engineer's core question was Payload CMS or code. The deciding force is precedent plus maintenance weight: every page in this repo keeps its copy in code and only records in the admin, so a CMS managed category page would be the first of its kind, carrying new admin styling and a second home for category truth. The kitchen edits plan prices and availability constantly (that is what Plans is for), but category page words change rarely, and when they do, a developer is already involved in most site changes. Option 2 would buy copy independence that nobody has asked for, at the cost of a new surface to keep on brand. The runner up is the hybrid (code defaults, admin overrides), and it stays the natural next step if the kitchen starts asking to reword these pages often.

The audience filter is client side pills rather than separate audience URLs because search engines do not need six near identical pages and the pills keep the address space and the sitemap honest: one page per category, three in total.

## Feature design

**Data model sketch**:

One guarded migration (the build plan sizes it). The feature reads what exists:

- `plans.category`: required select, values `ready-to-cook`, `ready-to-eat`, `fresh-from-produce` (added in spec 0007's follow up work, in the database via migration `20261105_170000_plan_category_audience`)
- `plans.audience`: required select, values `kids`, `adults`, `special`
- `plans.available`: checkbox controlling the paused state

The 2026-11-06 revision adds:

- `subcategories` (new Payload collection, staff write, public read): `title` text required (the filter label) and `category` select required carrying the same three values the Plans category select uses; the document id is the identity (no slug field)
- `plans.subcategory`: a new relation to `subcategories`, required in admin validation with no default; the column is added nullable so the migration never touches existing rows, and validation enforces the requirement from deployment on

The route's single input, the category slug, must be one of the three category values. Display labels (for example "Fresh from produce") live in the copy module, keyed by value, shared with the plan card badges so the two never drift apart.

**API surface**: no new endpoints or server actions. The pages are server components reading through Payload's local API, the same path the plans page uses.

| Surface | Method | Key inputs | Key outputs | Auth | Key errors |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/plans/[category]` (page) | GET | category: route param | rendered page | public | 404 for any slug outside the three values |

**Value sourcing**:

| Action | Value produced / displayed | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Render opening band | Eyebrow, headline, accent phrase, intro line | Copy module, keyed by category slug (new code file) |
| Render plan grid | Plan cards for the category | `plans` rows filtered by `category` (DB column) |
| Paused label on a card | Paused pill and no buy panel | `plans.available` (DB column) |
| Audience pills | Labels All, Kids, Adults, Special, each with an icon | Copy module (shared audience label map); icons are code in the filter component |
| Filtered grid | Cards matching the chosen audience | `plans.audience` (DB column), filtered client side |
| Empty state card | Heading, copy, WhatsApp CTA | Copy module for words; `footer.contact.whatsapp` global for the number (same source the plans page uses) |
| Page metadata | Title, description, canonical URL | Copy module; canonical derived from the category slug |
| Sitemap entry | One URL per category page | The three category values, added to `defaultSitemap` in `src/app/(frontend)/(sitemaps)/pages-sitemap.xml/route.ts` |
| Category links on badges | Link target and accessible name for each pill | Derived from `plans.category` value through the shared route map; accessible name from the copy module |
| Category page cross links | Links to the other two categories | Copy module (the three known values) |

**Key invariants**:

- The route accepts exactly the three category values; any other slug renders not found, through the site group's not found page
- A plan slug is unique (already enforced) and must not equal any category route value, enforced by validation on the Plans collection's slug field: a lowercase comparison against the reserved set, run on create and update, with the admin form error as the way a collision surfaces
- The audience filter never changes the URL and never triggers a server round trip
- The label map for badges and the copy module draw from one shared source, so a label never says one thing on a card and another on its page
- `PlanCard` stays a server component (it holds rich text and the purchase form). The client side filter receives an id to audience map and toggles card visibility only; cards never hydrate
- The category route owns the `/plans/<segment>` slot. A future plan detail page must live under a different prefix (for example `/plan/<slug>`); checkout is unaffected because plan slugs travel as query parameters, not path segments

The revision adds these invariants:

- A plan's subcategory always belongs to the plan's category: the save validation refuses a mismatched pair, so a card can never be offered under a category its subcategory does not serve
- A subcategory that plans still use cannot be deleted; staff reassign the plans first
- The filter art never reaches the accessible name: the audience icons are decorative, and every pill is named by its visible label

**Security model**:

Public read, no accounts, no personal data on these pages. Plans are already readable by anyone; writes stay staff only through the existing Plans collection access. The `subcategories` collection is public read (the pages need the option labels) and staff only write, matching Plans. No compliance scope is triggered (no payments, no health data on these pages; any health adjacent copy on a card still carries the notice block required by `design.md`, which is the card's job, not this page's).

**Critical test scenarios** (each maps to an acceptance criterion in `## Requirements`):

- Happy path: open `/plans/ready-to-cook`, see only ready to cook plans, pick Kids and see only kid plans without a reload, verifies **AC-1**, **AC-2**
- Failure case: open `/plans/lunch-plan` (a plan slug, not a category) and receive the not found page, verifies **AC-4**
- Empty case: open a category whose every plan is paused and see the paused cards, the paused notice and no buy action; open a filter choice with no cards and see the filter specific empty card with the WhatsApp button, verifies **AC-3**
- Accessibility: tab to the filter group, toggle a pill with the keyboard, hear the live region report the new count, verifies **AC-2**
- Subcategory case: creating or editing a plan with no subcategory is refused, verifies **AC-9**
- Admin/permission: a plan saved with a subcategory from another category is refused; deleting a subcategory that plans use is denied, verifies **AC-9**
- Art case: every audience pill renders its icon, and the pill's accessible name is exactly its label, verifies **AC-11**

## Build plan

No build approach is recorded for this feature, so the default applies: one end to end slice, which this small feature naturally is. No migration is needed (the schema change already shipped in migration `20261105_170000_plan_category_audience`).

1. Create the shared category module: route values, display labels, per category copy (eyebrow, headline, accent, intro, metadata), the filter specific empty line, and the route map badges use, satisfies **AC-1**, **AC-5**, **AC-6**
2. Reserve the three category slugs in the Plans collection's slug field validation (lowercase comparison, create and update; audience values are not reserved), satisfies **AC-7**
3. Build the dynamic route `/plans/[category]`, force-dynamic, with the opening band and the server rendered grid, reusing `PlanCard` and the `Section` band patterns from the plans page, and unknown slugs rendering the site group's not found page, satisfies **AC-1**, **AC-4**
4. Build the audience filter pills as a small client component that toggles card visibility (labelled group, pressed state, 44px targets, live region, no motion), satisfies **AC-2**
5. Wire the empty state card (with the filter specific line), the paused plans notice and the final call to action section, reusing the plans page's components and copy patterns, satisfies **AC-3**
6. Turn the category pill on `PlanCard` into a link with an accessible name, add the cross link row under the grid, and add the three category URLs to `defaultSitemap` in `src/app/(frontend)/(sitemaps)/pages-sitemap.xml/route.ts`, satisfies **AC-5**, **AC-6**

Revision tasks (2026-11-06, the subcategory layer), one guarded migration that creates the `subcategories` table and adds `plans.subcategory_id` nullable, with no backfill and no destructive statement (dev gets the schema by push, production by the compose migrate service):

7. Create the `subcategories` collection: title, category select, store grouping, staff only write and public read, satisfies **AC-8**
8. Add `plans.subcategory`: the relation with `filterOptions` limited to the plan's own category, the required with no default validation, the category match validation on save, the delete denial, and the guarded migration, satisfies **AC-9**
9. (withdrawn 2026-11-06) Extend the category page filter to two rows: fetch the category's subcategories server side, render the alphabetical pills only when options exist, combine the two filters client side, keep the empty state unchanged, and pass the id to label map to the client component, satisfies **AC-10**
10. Tests and typecheck: the collection and validation rules, the legacy plan matching only All, and the delete denial, satisfies **AC-8**, **AC-9**

Revision task (2026-11-06, the filter art), no migration (the audience icons are code):

11. Give the audience pills their art: an icon per pill, plus the tests that pin the accessible names, satisfies **AC-11**

## Consequences

**Positive**:
- Each category gets a focused, shareable shelf without any new admin surface
- The category labels become navigation, so the two label fields start earning their keep
- Adding a fourth category later is a copy entry and a select option, not a new page build

**Negative / tradeoffs**:
- Category page words change only through a code change and a deploy
- The address space under `/plans` now splits between the shelf and three reserved category slugs, a rule future plan slugs must respect
- A refreshed or shared filtered view always lands back on All, because the filter is deliberately not in the web address; nobody should later "fix" this with query parameters, which would create six near identical indexable variants

**Neutral**:
- The sitemap grows by three URLs
- `/plans` keeps its current look; only the badges on cards change (from plain text to links)
- Header and footer category links, if wanted, are admin work in Site chrome, not code

**Added by the 2026-11-06 revision**:

Positive:
- Finer grouping needs no developer: the kitchen owns the option list, per category
- The filter stays client side, so the address space and the sitemap stay honest: still three pages

Negative / tradeoffs:
- The subcategory layer now has no page that reads it, so it serves the kitchen's own labels until it earns a surface
- A second filter row was tried and withdrawn, churn the audience pills now avoid

Neutral:
- One guarded migration (a new table plus a nullable column); no backfill, nothing destructive

## Follow-up

- [x] Enroll a scope feature row for this feature (done: scope row 5, Plan category pages)
- [ ] The kitchen can add category links to the header or footer themselves in the admin under Site chrome; no code needed, and not part of this build
- [ ] The three existing plans carry placeholder labels (ready to eat, adults) from the backfill; the kitchen should correct them in the admin, especially `kids-plan`
- [ ] If the kitchen later wants to reword category pages themselves, revisit the hybrid option (code defaults, admin overrides)
- [ ] Staff assign subcategories to the three existing plans in the admin, alongside the placeholder label fixes they already owe
- [ ] If subcategory pages or card badges are wanted later, design them then: routes under a category would need reserved slugs and sitemap entries, and badges would add a third label to the cards

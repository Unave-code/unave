# Scope: Unave content site

A Payload and Next.js site for the Unave cloud kitchen: content pages, posts, an enquiry pipeline and customer accounts. The kitchen takes orders by message, not through the site. The earlier plan catalogue, cart, checkout and the Razorpay payment layer were removed on 2026-10-31 and their database tables dropped.

**Build approach:** Tracer Bullet (prove the whole pipe with one real user path, then thicken it).
**Workflow:** Beta (after `/develop`: `/check verify`, then `/test`). The project default level of rigor. `/architect` is the recommended first stop for a feature with a real decision, but skippable when you already know the build. Any feature can carry its own tag (e.g. `· GA`) to do more or less.

_These are recommendations to keep your build orderly, not requirements. Skip anything that does not fit: if you already know how to build a feature, use `/develop` and skip `/architect`. You decide when a feature is `done`._

## Removed

**Plans, subscriptions, cart, checkout and Razorpay. Removed on 2026-10-31, after they were built.** The site stopped selling plans: the `plans`, `subscriptions` and `payments` collections, the `/plans` and `/cart` routes, the order-placed page, the Razorpay client, webhook and migration, and the plan emails (cancellation) were deleted, and the database tables and their rows were dropped by `src/migrations/20261031_180000_remove_plans_subscriptions.ts`. Specs 0001, 0003, 0004 and 0007 were deleted rather than kept as history. The kitchen now takes orders by message (WhatsApp, phone, email, the contact form). What survives of that work: the `customers` collection and the account screens, now carrying saved delivery details and a food preference, and the transactional email plumbing. The same day, the kitchen decided to sell through the site again: feature 4 below rebuilds this, built fresh rather than restored from git history.

## Foundations

### 1. Transactional email · done

## Slice 1: Supporting pages

### 2. About and contact · in-progress
Two public pages: `/about`, which tells the story of the kitchen, and `/contact`, which gathers WhatsApp, phone, email and the site's first public write path, an enquiry form that stores a row and emails the kitchen.
**Done when:** both pages render with their copy and images, the enquiry form stores a row and notifies the kitchen without JavaScript, and bad input is answered with a plain sentence.

## Slice 2: Customer identity

### 3. Customer accounts · in-progress (building)
A customer signs in with email and password, or with Google, and keeps their delivery details and food preference with the kitchen on one page. With plans gone, the account is a saved profile and a session, not a plan manager.
**Done when:** a customer can sign up with email and password, confirm their address, reset a forgotten password, or sign in with Google, then see and save their delivery details and food preference, and can never reach the CMS.
**Supersedes:** the account decisions in specs 0001 and 0003, and the "No account. No password." promise in `design.md`.

## Slice 3: Ordering

### 4. Plans and payments · in-progress (Best sellers revision pending) · GA
The kitchen sells plans through the site again, built fresh rather than restored from the removed build. A plan is a duration paid upfront, say a week or a month of meals, collected through an online payment gateway (Razorpay is the named pick; the spec owns that decision). A plan card carries a duration choice and one Add to cart control, the basket lives in a browser cookie (identifiers only, 10 line cap, duplicates refused), the cart page shows live prices, checkout requires sign in and pays the whole basket once, and staff manage plans and see orders with all their items in the Payload admin. (The 2026-11-06 spec revision restored the cart that the earlier revision had removed; the acceptance criteria were renumbered.)
**Supersedes:** the "an account only saves details" promise in `design.md`: buying now requires an account, so that contract changes at spec time, while browsing and messaging stay open to everyone.
**Done when:** a visitor can browse plans and fill a basket without an account, review the cart at live prices, sign in at checkout, pay once for the whole basket, and the kitchen sees each order with its lines and can edit plans, prices and availability in the admin; the chrome copy no longer says one plan per order. The homepage Best sellers section shows only available featured products, with compact cards and optional old price and pack size details for one time products.

## Slice 4: Browsing by category

### 5. Plan category pages · in-progress (subcategory revision, assumed decision spec 0009)
One page per product category (`/products/ready-to-cook`, `/products/ready-to-eat`, `/products/fresh-from-produce`) with the shared shelf controls and category badges linking to each page. Copy lives in code, product data in the Products collection. The kitchen manages required subcategories in Payload; each may have a Media image and has a required unique slug generated from its title. Products must choose a subcategory in the same category. Homepage subcategory tiles use the assumed query-filter decision in spec 0009.
**Done when:** all three pages render with their category content and shared shelf controls, unknown category slugs show not found, empty states behave as specified, the sitemap contains the three URLs, and staff can manage Subcategory images and unique generated slugs in the admin. Homepage subcategory tiles open the matching category shelf filtered to that subcategory, and existing subcategory records have unique slugs.

## Deferred

Out of scope for this build pass, kept so the plan stays honest.

- **Fulfilment states and auto renewal**: order states with staff actions such as cancellation and refund notes, and auto renewing subscriptions · both cut from feature 4's first pass
- **A weekly menu page**: the header and footer promise a menu that has no page yet
- **SMS and WhatsApp**: notification channel beyond email · needs a decision
- **Email delivery events**: bounce and complaint webhooks, plus alerts on repeated send failure · from spec 0002 · needs a decision
- **Analytics**: conversion events and product analytics · needs a decision

## Legend

**The decision box.** Every feature carries exactly one, the sub-task whose label ends with `(spec)`. Its wording varies (`Design it (spec)` normally), so skills locate it by that `(spec)` suffix, never by an exact label. Every other box is an execution box and `/architect` never ticks one.

**Feature lifecycle**: the scope updates as a feature moves; each row is what it shows and who sets it:

| State | Set by | The feature shows |
|---|---|---|
| `planned` · needs a decision | `/scope` | one box: `Design it (spec): /architect <feature>` |
| `in-progress` (designed) | **`/architect` at spec capture** | `Design it` ticked; spec linked; `Build it: /develop <feature>` + **2 to 5 milestones**; the tier's closing boxes (`Verify it`, `Test it`) |
| `in-progress` (building) | `/develop` | milestone sub-boxes tick one by one; code pointer filled |
| `in-progress` (verified) | `/check verify` | `Build it` + milestones ticked; `Verify it` ticked |
| `done` | **you, when you decide it is** | boxes you ran ticked, skipped ones marked skipped |

- **Next step** = the first unticked box (always a command or a tracked milestone).
- **needs a decision** = run `/architect` first; otherwise straight to `/develop`.
- **Status** `planned` → `in-progress` → `done`, plus `existing` (pre-workflow) and `dropped` (de-scoped, kept for history).
- **Pointer line** (`spec <n> · code in <path>`): the spec link added by `/architect`, the code path by `/develop`.
